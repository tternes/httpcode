203: Non-Authoritative Information
The returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the
definitive set as available from the origin server, but is gathered
from a local or a third-party copy. The set presented MAY be a subset
or superset of the original version. For example, including local
annotation information about the resource might result in a superset
of the metainformation known by the origin server. Use of this
response code is not required and is only appropriate when the
response would otherwise be 200 (OK).
